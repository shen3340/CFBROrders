# CFBROrders: A supplemental site for College Football Risk teams

---

CFBROrders is a supplemental site for [College Football Risk](https://collegefootballrisk.com/) teams to use to monitor and allocate orders.  

### Goals
* **Easier setup for teams:** Unlike the old orders site, CFBROrders requires no programming experience to use.
* **More customization:** Supports multiple teams, Reddit and Discord authentication, and comprehensive order monitoring.

### Inspiration
* [u/Tapin42's cfbr_orders](https://www.github.com/Tapin42/cfbr_orders/) original orders site.
