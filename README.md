# CFBROrders: A supplemental site for College Football Risk teams

---

CFBROrders is a supplemental site for [College Football Risk](https://collegefootballrisk.com/) teams to use to monitor and allocate orders. The goals of CFBROrders are as follows: 

* **An easier setup for teams.** The old orders site took a good amount of programming setup from the front end. By switching to a full-fledged website, CFBROrders allows teams with no programming background to use the site.
* **More customization.** The old orders site was meant for only one team to use and for Reddit as the sole authentication method. CFBROrders allows for Reddit and Discord authentication as well as the ability to monitor orders for all teams involved.
  
CFBROrders  is inspired by:
* [u/Tapin42's](https://www.github.com/Tapin42/cfbr_orders/) cfbr_orders original orders site
